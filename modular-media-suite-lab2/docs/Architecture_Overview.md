The Modular Media Streaming Suite rearchitects a monolithic media player into a modular, extensible system using structural design patterns to support diverse media sources (local files, HLS streams, remote APIs), dynamic feature plugins (subtitles, equalizer, watermarking), composite playlists, runtime renderer switching (hardware/software), and stream caching. A Media Source interface with adapters unifies sources, decorators add features, a composite structure manages playlists, a strategy pattern enables renderer flexibility, and a proxy caches remote streams. The Media Player core, coordinated by a Configuration Manager, ensures modularity, extensibility, and maintainability, overcoming the legacy codebaseâ€™s limitations.





Core Components:



Media Source Abstraction (Adapter Pattern)

A unified MediaSource interface abstracts various media sources (local files, HLS streams, remote APIs).

Adapters (LocalFileAdapter, HLSStreamAdapter, RemoteAPIAdapter) convert disparate source-specific interfaces into a common interface, enabling seamless integration and eliminating duplicated adaptation code.







Feature Plugins (Decorator Pattern)

A MediaProcessor interface defines pluggable features (e.g., subtitle rendering, audio equalizer, watermarking).

Decorators (SubtitleDecorator, EqualizerDecorator, WatermarkDecorator) wrap core media playback, allowing on-the-fly feature addition without modifying the core player logic.







Composite Playlists (Composite Pattern)

A PlaylistComponent interface unifies single media items (MediaItem) and composite playlists (Playlist).

This enables hierarchical playlist structures where playlists can contain both individual files and nested sub-playlists, managed recursively.







Rendering Strategy (Strategy Pattern)

A Renderer interface abstracts rendering strategies (hardware vs. software).

Concrete implementations (HardwareRenderer, SoftwareRenderer) allow runtime switching to optimize performance based on device capabilities or user preferences.







Remote Stream Caching (Proxy Pattern)

A MediaSourceProxy acts as a proxy for remote media sources, caching streams locally to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.

The proxy implements the same MediaSource interface, ensuring transparency to the client code.
